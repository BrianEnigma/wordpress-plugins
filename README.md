#WordPress Plugins

This is a collection of WordPress plugins I've written for Netninja.com.
They're fairly specific to my site and not (yet?) general-purpose enough to
share on the WordPress.org site.

The plugins include:

* lj-old :: Adds boilerplate text to posts before 2007-04-08 stating that
the post was imported from LiveJournal and that a more rich experience
might be over there (comments, integrated polls, etc.) with a link to
that day's archive on LJ.

* netninja-categories :: Adds category icons to certain categories.

* hipsterpda-shortcode :: Defines a shortcode to put at the top of all
HipsterPDA posts that links to all other HipsterPDA posts.

* custom-meta :: various constant HTML META attributes to put in the document
header.
